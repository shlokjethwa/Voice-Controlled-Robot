IOT car controlled through a mobile app using Voice
Voice Controlled Robot (VCR) is a mobile robot whose motions the user can control by giving specific voice commands.

In this unit, we capture the speech signals coming from the microphone attached to the mobile device. The software running on the device processes the signals to recognize the voice commands ‘Forward’, ‘Stop’, ‘Left’, ’Right’, ‘Little left’, ‘Little right’, ‘Turn around’ and ‘Back’. These commands are sent over wirelessly to the microcontroller-based robot, which will perform the tasks accordingly.

MIT App Inventor is an intuitive, visual programming environment that allows everyone – even children – to build fully functional apps for smartphones and tablets. Those new to MIT App Inventor can have a simple first app up and running in less than 30 minutes. And what's more, our blocks-based tool facilitates the creation of complex, high-impact apps in significantly less time than traditional programming environments. The MIT App Inventor project seeks to democratize software development by empowering all people, especially young people, to move from technology consumption to technology creation.

The MIT App Inventor lets you develop applications for Android phones using a web browser and either a connected phone or emulator. The App Inventor servers store your work and help you keep track of your projects.

Steps to do the functioning of the robot:
1-	Turn on the android app in your smartphone, which was already made in MIT app inventor.
2-	The user need to login in this app in order to access it.
3-	Then there is also an option to save the login credentials.
4-	Once the login is done then the main screen opens.
5-	If the Bluetooth if your smart phone is off then this app would ask the permission to turn on the Bluetooth.
6-	Therefore, as soon as the Bluetooth is turned on you can click on a button and see the available devices near you.
7-	Here we have used the latest android version phone i.e. android version 9.0(Pie) in the smart phone and the HC-05 module is working just fine.
8-	So from the available devices connect to the desired device that is the HC-05 module here.
9-	Then once you click on that device then it will demand a passkey.
10-	So enter the passkey as 1234, which is the default password for the HC-05 module.
11-	Once the password is added then the device is connected.
12-	After the connection is established, then click on the mic button and speak a command.
13-	So speak one of the predefined commands then the action will be seen in the robot. If command differs then no action will be seen.
14-	Therefor the robot starts moving as per your command.

Thus the automation through voice control and also through mobile control has been designed and implemented. An Atmega328 microcontroller is used at the robot. A wireless connectivity between the android phone and the robot was developed using Bluetooth technology.

Assistive technologies have been given a considerable degree of importance since the past decade. With the advent of newer, faster and accurate microprocessors and microcontroller, development in this field got an urge to a completely new level. With our project, the handicapped can reduce its workload by using the robot as a personal assistant. For the blind, it is especially beneficial as it would be difficult for them to do work themselves. This technology can be used worldwide in various situations since a microcontroller is not just restricted to a robot.

With an additional camera feature on the robot, we can also get the live feed of the scene in front of the camera. This expands its applications like surveillance system used in military especially. We can thus send the robot to inhabited territories and navigate the robot from a distance.

Thus, to conclude, a voice controlled robot using android is a step closer to making this world an easier place to live in by automating many different processes.
